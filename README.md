# c-wspp-rs

A drop-in replacement [c-wspp](https://github.com/black-sliver/c-wspp) written in Rust powered by [yawc](https://github.com/infinitefield/yawc).

Provides extra enhanced functionality and cleaner code compared to the original library. Supports compression with context takeover.

This works best with the forked version of [c-wspp-websocket-sharp](https://github.com/JKLeckr/c-wspp-websocket-sharp) wrapper that has some improvments and support for the enhanced features.
